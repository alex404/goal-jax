# Goal: Geometric OptimizAtion Libraries

# goal-jax

A JAX implementation of information geometric algorithms and exponential families.

## Overview

`goal-jax` provides tools for working with exponential families and their geometry, including:

* Efficient implementations of common exponential families
* Automatic conversion between different parameterizations (natural â†” mean)
* Specialized linear operators for covariance structures
* Information geometric optimization tools
